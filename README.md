# Delivery Time Prediction

This project aims to predict the estimated delivery time for orders using ElasticNet machine learning model. The model is trained on DoorDash data, utilizing various features such as order details, dashers, traffic conditions, and delivery distance.

## Features

- Database: PostgreSQL is used to store and retrieve training and inference data.
- Model Tracking: MLflow is implemented for experiment tracking and model management.
- Deployment: A [Streamlit](https://delivery-time-prediction-app.streamlit.app/) application is built to make predictions easily accessible.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- PostgreSQL
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Joblib
- MLflow
- Streamlit
